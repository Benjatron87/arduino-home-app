# arduino-home-app

## Node.js application that reads data and controlls devices by communicating with a NodeMCU WiFi enabled device.

### The NodeMCU is programed with the Arduino IDE and controls 3 relay switches while also providing temperature data and the position of my bedrrom door with a 10k thermistor and proximity sensor. 

### This is essentially a home automation system that allows you to control things in your home from anywhere.
